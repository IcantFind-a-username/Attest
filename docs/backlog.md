# Backlog

Findings that did not earn a fix, one line each: `file:line — what, and why it
was not fixed now`.

Per D-049, a self-review defect earns a commit only when it can be reproduced.
Everything else lands here: unreproduced "could in principle" hardening, and
every finding from a second review round. Nothing here is a promise to act —
this is the drawer, and items leave it only when a task is scoped to them or a
reproduction turns one into a real defect.

<!-- entries below, newest first -->

- `src/attest/review/history.py:1` — call-graph reachability and test-blind-spot slices were
  intentionally excluded from the first F-channel scope; either slice needs an independently
  preregistered owner work order before implementation or measurement.
- `src/attest/review/executor.py:46` — D-037(c) remains reproducible: all four schema-valid
  reproductions in the bounded Wave 4 retest attempted child processes under the unchanged
  container guard. Runner process/resource policy and compatibility design are explicitly out
  of scope here and require a separate owner decision; no further prompt or runner change was
  retained.
- `src/attest/review/ledger.py:80` — shared `ci_final` validation preserves `ValueError`
  behavior but changed several message strings; no repository caller depends on them, and
  the later-round compatibility concern is deferred under D-049 rather than opening another
  repair loop.
